# Decky TDP Control [![Chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20discord-7289da.svg)](https://deckbrew.xyz/discord)

This repository contains a tool designed to address an issue with the built-in TDP slider in the quick settings menu on some devices running Steam OS. When the slider fails to work, users can use this tool to adjust the TDP and set custom limits.

### Important: 
Please be aware that using incorrect TDP values with this tool may cause damage to your device's CPU. I strongly advise that you double check your device's specifications before setting custom TDP limits. By using this tool, you assume all responsibility for any damage that may occur to your device.
